 * and in the browser alike.
 *
 * Items are matched to people by tag, never by condition. That is what
 * lets 117 catalog conditions share one body of guidance instead of
 * needing bespoke copy each, and it is why adding a condition to the
 * catalog is a data change rather than a content project.
 *
 * Everything here is general lifestyle guidance of the kind found in
 * public-health material. None of it is medical advice, none of it is
 * personalised to a diagnosis, and nothing about a family history changes
 * what the guidance says. The UI states this plainly.
